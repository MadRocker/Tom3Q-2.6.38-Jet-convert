Thanks to Tom3Q for his git://github.com/tom3q/spica-2.6.38.git and making 
it easier to convert our Jet to a later kernel.

This original files boots the GT-i5700 

What:
* This files is all WIP "Work In Progress" .
* Names and kconfig + Makefiles have been adjusted but all need more attention.
* Several files like audio needs corrected values for buttons volume etc...

Next step:
* Need to add more files related to Jet hardware as well as their specific 
  Makefiles and Kconfig to complete this.
* Also need to add and convert older 2.6.29 files to 2.6.38 layout like 
  s3cfb_ams310fn07 and related.
* Need to add the desperate 2.6.38 modules to complete this.

Possible errors:
* The audio file might need to change from ak4671 to ?? .
